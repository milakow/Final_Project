__General Information__

The idea to create this project was to speed up making of repetitive graphs. During my Engineer Thesis I have spent definitely too much time on changing different parameters in Excel. That is why I have decided to write a code that allows user to prepare plots in less than half a minute.
Currently (July/2022), working in the steel structure industry, I can also use this code to run various projects.

__Technologies Used__

  - Python 3.10.2
  
  - NumPy 1.23.0
  
  - matplotlib.pyplot 3.5.2
  
  - easygui 0.98.3
  
  - pathlib
  



__Screenshots__

First program asks us to choose file with data. Files with the csv extension are intentionally set.

Based on user data 'Graph Maker' prepares a plot for user and counts average and standard deviation.

__Project Status__

Project is: complete.
However, my next goal is to enable the use of databases and making graphs based on them.
